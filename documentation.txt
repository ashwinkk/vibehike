So the root of the website presents the screen to upload file and input the 2 urls.
There is a check box to follow the user.
On submitting the form a post request is sent to the server which takes the song url and opens up the player using the sound cloud api.
Then there is a download button to download the uploaded file from the server. The file is stored along with the staic files inside a dynamically generated directory.The download starts only if the user had checked the follow button in the first page.

Haven't done the file size checking and ajax download button.

getsong is the app name which does all the fucnctions mentioned above. The app uses a single table which stores the files and the song url incase we need them for later use.

Additionally, packages like six,soundcloud and python-mysql should be installed. Django base version 1.9 is used.
